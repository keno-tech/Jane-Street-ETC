## What I liked
One thing I particularly enjoyed was the opportunity to learn and apply new concepts in real-time. Through the competition, I was able to witness the practical application of algorithmic trading strategies and see firsthand how they produced measurable results. It was incredibly satisfying to see my progress in the competition as I honed my skills and adapted to changing market conditions. <br>

In addition to the intellectually stimulating atmosphere of the competition, I appreciated the thoughtful touches that Jane Street provided for participants. Throughout the event, they offered a variety of complimentary refreshments, including delicious snacks, drinks, and even tea. It was clear that the organizers had gone out of their way to make the competition experience as enjoyable and comfortable as possible for all attendees. <br>

The Jane Street engineers were always available to assist participants during the competition. Their willingness to share their insights and provide guidance was invaluable, and I found myself looking up to them as role models. I would be thrilled to have the opportunity to work alongside such talented professionals in the future.
